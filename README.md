# Code_For_Hackathon
 ## Configuration:
  1. Python version 3.8 for back-end 
  2. HTML5, CSS and JavaScript for website design
  
  
 ## Installation:
  1. Pandas python library <br>
     Using pip install pandas==1.0.1 or [click here](https://pypi.org/project/pandas/)
  2. scikit-learn pythonlibrary <br>
     Using pip install scikit-learn==0.22.1 or [click here](https://pypi.org/project/scikit-learn/)
     
     
     
 ## Operation: 
  1.	The person will be asked to create his personal profile.
  2.	We will then compare the profiles of different users using the "hackathon.py" program which uses a machine learning algorithm called K-means clustering.
     This algorithm groups the users based on their interests entered in the profile details. Then they will be notified about the other users thorgh mail
  3.	The present whereabouts of other companies and start-ups can be found in the updates feed of the website.
  4.	Based on his/her budget, profile details, location and loan requirements they will be redirected to a recommended bank website and potential investors.

## Possible bugs :
