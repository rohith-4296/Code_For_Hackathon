 ## Operation: 
  1.	The person will be asked to create his personal profile.
  2.	Then we will compare profiles created by different people and connect them to the people who have similar ideas or interests. They will be updated timely about                   other like-minded through e-mail.
  3.	The present whereabouts of other companies and start-ups can be found in the updates feed of the website.

 ## Files included : 
  1. "hackathon.py" that contains the program for the K-means clustering algorithm.
  2. "hackathon_dataset.csv" that contains the sign-up data of the users entered in the website.
  3. "Cluster_category.csv" that contains the data of the group assigned to the users.




## Possible bugs : 
  1. Due to lack of large dataset(at present) for K-means algorithm the program may not work at its best accuracy.
  2. The user profile is being stored in CSV files due to lack of server.
